## About

The original procedures uses python and jupyter for analysis which never explained the logic for there analysis and the jupyter notebook never provieded any dashboard for clean analysis.

As the dataset is not that big, so for data insights, EXCEL was used instead of SQL. But cleaning data in the excel is not reliable at all and even more time consuming than SQL.

Too much of manual work you know.

Now here comes the role on R where you just need to define a function in a pipline.

## Data Pipeline in R

```bash
  data_clean = df %>%
    drop_na()
```

## About Dataset

The dataset is made by IBM scientists as per the acknowledgement. It gives the detailed information about the employess to the HR Department. The below information is from the original dataset. The int values were replaced with its char values by the acknowledgement.

 - Data visualization using Tableau.

## Data Cleaning

In the dataset, the coversion of paraemters - Education, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction, PerformanceRating, RelationshipSatisfaction and WorkLifeBalance from int to char where performed.

For Education

```bash
  dataclean$education[dataclean$education == 5] = "Doctor"
```

For EnvironmentSatisfaction

```bash
  dataclean$environment_satisfaction[dataclean$environment_satisfaction == 4] = "Very High"
```

For JobInvolvement

```bash
  dataclean$job_involvement[dataclean$job_involvement == 4] = "Very High"
```

For JobSatisfaction

```bash
  dataclean$job_satisfaction[dataclean$job_satisfaction == 4] = "Very High"
```

For PerformanceRating

```bash
  dataclean$performance_rating[dataclean$performance_rating == 4] = "Outstanding"
```

For RelationshipSatisfaction

```bash
  dataclean$work_life_balance[dataclean$work_life_balance == 4] = "Best"
```

For WorkLifeBalance

```bash
  dataclean$relationship_satisfaction[dataclean$relationship_satisfaction == 4] = "Very High"
```

Further, for employees age and over18 columns, the over18 column has Y (Yes) as input for those who are 18 yrs of age. Then converted Y to 1 and N to 0 for count.

```bash
  dataclean$over18[dataclean$age == 18] = "N"
  dataclean$over18[dataclean$over18 == "Y"] = 1
```

Converted overtime and attrition from (Yes, No) to (1, 0). 

```bash
  dataclean$over_time[dataclean$over_time == "Yes"] = 1
  dataclean$attrition[dataclean$attrition == "Yes"] = 1
```

Removing unnecessary columns and cleaning at the end if some NAs left.

```bash
  subset(dataclean, select = -c(daily_rate, 
                                hourly_rate, 
                                monthly_rate, 
                                standard_hours, 
                                stock_option_level, 
                                training_times_last_year, 
                                years_since_last_promotion))
  na.omit(dataclean)
```

## New Parameters

Created 3 new parameter that are:

 - Male
 - Female
 - Attrition_str

Wanted to count total number of males and females, so created separated column for it as it makes logic.

```bash
  dataclean$male = c(dataclean$gender)
  dataclean$male[dataclean$male == "Male"] = 1
  dataclean$female = c(dataclean$gender)
  dataclean$female[dataclean$female == "Male"] = 0
```

Also, Wanted to show attrition in graph but numbers dosen't look good in x-axis. So created new column for attrition as attrition_str.

```bash
  dataclean$attrition_str = c(dataclean$attrition)
  dataclean$attrition_str[dataclean$attrition_str == 1] = "Yes"
```

## Visualizations

The visualization were made using Tableau.
